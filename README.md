Objective

The project aims to develop a real-time health monitoring website based on Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), focusing on continuously tracking vital health parameters and raising alerts when abnormalities are detected. The system is designed to simulate data from wearable sensors for parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, oxygen levels, and ECG signals.

Features

1. Real-Time Data Visualization

Displays dynamic updates of health metrics every 3 seconds.

Vital parameters monitored include:

Heart Rate

Blood Pressure

Body Temperature

Oxygen Levels

ECG (Electrocardiogram)




2. Custom Alert Thresholds

Users can input custom threshold values for specific parameters.

Alerts trigger when a sensor reading exceeds the set threshold.



3. Alerts and Notifications

Alerts are displayed on the dashboard to inform users of abnormal readings.

Helps in early detection of potential health issues.



4. User-Friendly Interface

Clean and responsive design built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Mobile-friendly, ensuring compatibility with devices like the Moto G45.



5. Local Storage for Thresholds

Threshold settings persist in the browser, allowing continuity between sessions.

Technology Stack

Frontend Development:

HTML: Structure of the website.

CSS: Styling and layout.

JavaScript: Dynamic behavior, data simulation, and interactivity.

How It Works

1. Data Simulation

Random values are generated to mimic real-time health data collected from wearable sensors.

The data is updated and displayed on the dashboard every 3 seconds.



2. Threshold-Based Alerts

Users define thresholds for key health metrics.

If a reading exceeds the set value, the system raises an alert in real-time.



3. Visualization and Interaction

The dashboard provides a clear view of current health data.

Users interact with the system by customizing thresholds through the settings interface.

Scalability:

The system can be extended to handle multiple users or a broader range of health metrics.

Integration with IoT devices for remote health monitoring.
